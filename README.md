This project is a multi-phase machine learning pipeline for classifying plant diseases, detailed across a series of Jupyter notebooks. It begins by establishing a baseline with a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on raw image data in phase1.ipynb. The pipeline then explores image pre-processing in phase2.ipynb by applying an edge detection filter to create a new dataset, on which a separate CNN is trained and evaluated in phase2.1.ipynb and phase2.2.ipynb. Shifting from images, phase3.ipynb and phase4.ipynb introduce models that use tabular data: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for environmental factors and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for time-series data, respectively. The final notebook, ensemble.ipynb, integrates these three distinct models into a single, comprehensive ensemble model that leverages the diverse data types to achieve a more robust and accurate classification of plant diseases.
